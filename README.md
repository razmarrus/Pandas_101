# Pandas 101

This repo is, mostly, just a copypasta from tiny free course that may be find [there](https://bitbucket.org/hrojas/learn-pandas/src/master/).  
I will keep it there as a quick reminder of basic pandas syntax.

Note, that course consists of 11 lessons, while only 7 of them are there. I don't see practical use of taking notes for 8-11 lessons, so wouldn't push it there
